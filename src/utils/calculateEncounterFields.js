export function calculateEncounterFields(baseEncounter, campaign) {
  // Here, you can call your existing generateEncounterData if you like,
  // or re-use some of the logic from encounterDataGenerator directly.
  // This example just calls that function to produce derived data:

  // Because generateEncounterData expects (currentCampaign, encounters),
  // you might adapt it slightly for a single encounter instance.
  // For demonstration, let's assume the baseEncounter has an array of "encountersSoFar"
  // or you pass in the entire array as a second parameter.

  // If you're only calculating fields for one new encounter, you might
  // pass an empty array or the existing ones. We'll do something basic here:

  const derived = {
    // For example, if your baseEncounter is missing some fields that you
    // calculate from the campaign, add them here.
    xpThresholdsByCharacterLevel: campaign.xpThresholds || {
      easy: 0,
      medium: 0,
      hard: 0,
      deadly: 0,
    },
    // Suppose you also calculate some random fields or re-check difficulty, etc.
    // ...
  }

  return {
    ...baseEncounter,
    ...derived,
